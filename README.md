03-02-2025 - EEOB546_R_Lesson Project Start


03-18-2025 - R Assignment Start

Created two R script files, one for basic inspection and another for
data processing. Will work on visualization today and tomorrow.

03-19-2025

Finished visualization by implemnting chunks to handle large data processing.
I'm assuming most finished their R projects on Nova or used the ISU system to send
larger files for processing, but I used a lot of outside resources to finish this
without the need for server processing.

Used data tables instead of data frames for a lot of data processing, so if it 
looks confusing to you that may be why.
