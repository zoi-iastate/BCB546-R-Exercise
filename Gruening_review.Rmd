### Overall your code looks great and I can see what you did.
# For the data inspection I think you can be a little bit more specific and look at the rows, columns or the size of the files. I have put some example codes below. 

```{r}
# Number of rows and columns and size of the files 
nrow()
ncol()
colnames()
format(object.size(), units = "auto")
```

## The data processing part, looked good to me. Maybe you can look into alternatives to for loop.

## I had some error in the visualization part.
# The Error was: 'Error: object 'process_chunk' not found'
# Maybe you can look into that.
